# *ETL Pipeline for MySQL Database*

## 📌 *Project Overview*
This project demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline implementation for a MySQL database. It involves extracting data from CSV files, cleaning and transforming it using Python, and loading it into a MySQL database for analysis. The pipeline concludes with analytical insights derived using SQL queries and Python.

---

## 📂 *Dataset Used*
- *Datasets*: 
  - customers.csv  
  - products.csv  
  - orders.csv  
  - payments.csv
- The datasets include features such as *Customer Details, **Order Details, **Product Information, and **Payment Transactions*.

---

## 🛠 *Data Processing Steps*

### *1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation (Python)*
- Removed missing values and duplicates.  
- Converted inconsistent data types to ensure integrity.  
- Handled referential constraints to align datasets for database integration.  

### *2️⃣ Database Integration (MySQL)*
- Designed and implemented the database schema with *Primary Keys* and *Foreign Keys* to ensure relational integrity.  
- Created tables: Customers, Products, Orders, and Payments.

### *3️⃣ Data Loading (Python)*
- Utilized MySQL Connector and SQLAlchemy libraries to push transformed data into MySQL tables.  
- Verified data insertion through validation queries.

### *4️⃣ Analytical Queries (SQL)*
- Wrote SQL queries to extract insights, such as:
  - Top customers by spending.
  - Most popular product categories.
  - Orders without successful payments.

## 📊 *Analytical Insights*

### *Key Queries & Insights*

1. *Retrieve All Customer Details*
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers;
 ``` 


2. *Find Top 5 Customers by Spending*
```sql
SELECT c.name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent 
FROM Customers c 
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id 
GROUP BY c.customer_id 
ORDER BY total_spent DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```



3. *Find the Most Popular Product Category*
```sql
SELECT p.category, COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders 
FROM Products p 
JOIN Orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id 
GROUP BY p.category 
ORDER BY total_orders DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

## 📌 *Highlights*


### *Key Insights*
- *Most popular product category*: Clothing
- *Month with the most orders*: January
- *Most used payment method*: Cash On Delivery

---

## 🚀 *Future Work*
- Add support for *PostgreSQL* and other databases.
- Automate the ETL process for *real-time data ingestion*.
- Integrate *visualization tools* for enhanced reporting.
